## Grammar Overview

### What is the past perfect tense?

The past perfect tense is used to describe an action that was **completed** before another action took place in the **past**. It is formed using "had" followed by the past participle of the verb.

**Example:** I had finished my homework before I went to school.

Let issus the sentence above, if I break it down according to the sentence action are following the below table:

| Order | Action |
|-------|--------|  
| 1st   | I had finished my homework. |
| 2nd   | I went to school. |

**Note**: <span style="color:red; font-weight:600;"> Past Perfect is one way to tell the order of actions that happened in the past. Therefore, that means you do not always need a past perfect (all the time) to tell it. You can also use other ways to do it as well, like using prepositions (before, until, previous..) to tell the order.</span>

**How?** I finished my homework before I went to school.

### When to use the past perfect tense?

        - They had spoken to her before she left the office.
