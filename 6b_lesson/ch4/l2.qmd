### What is the second conditional?

The **second conditional** is used to talk about **imaginary**, **unreal**, or **unlikely situations** in the present or future. It is often used when we imagine things that are not true right now — like having superpowers.

**Example:** If I were invisible, I would help people without being seen.

In this example, the speaker is not actually invisible. It is only an imaginary situation.

### When to use the second conditional?

1. To talk about unreal or imaginary situations.
2. To give advice or imagine different results.
3. To describe superhero abilities that do not exist in real life.

* Example Sentences:

  * If she had super strength, she would lift heavy buildings.
  * If they were superheroes, they would protect the city.
  * If he could fly, he would rescue people from danger.

### How to form the second conditional?

The second conditional uses the **past simple** in the if-clause and **would + base verb** in the main clause.

<span style='color:blue; font-weight:600;'>Formula:</span>
**If + subject + past simple, subject + would + base verb**

* Example Sentences:

  * If I were a superhero, I would save the world.
  * If she had laser eyes, she would stop the villains.
  * If we lived in a superhero city, we would feel safer.

### Questions

To form questions, move **would** to the front of the main clause.

<span style='color:blue; font-weight:600;'>Formula:</span>
